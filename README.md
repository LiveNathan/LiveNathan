## 📈 Case Study: Allied Productions Labor Management System

**Timeline:** 4 months | **Industry:** AV Production & Event Management

### 🔧 The Challenge: "A Time-Consuming Process with a Lot of Manual Data Entry"

Allied Productions had a functional but tedious labor booking workflow. Jesse Andler (Labor Manager) was managing everything effectively, but spending significant time on repetitive manual tasks:

**The Daily Inefficiencies:**
- **24-hour lag time** - Lasso only imported new events from Flex once per day
- **Incorrect import data** - System pulled trucking dates instead of actual crew call times
- **Manual corrections required** - Jesse had to fix dates and times for each event
- **Scattered information** - Contacts spread across Flex, Lasso, and Monday without synchronization
- **Annual manual updates** - Contractor information updated once yearly via Monday.com form, then manually entered

> "We use a lot of different apps for what we do and that's part of the problem and I wish it was all on one app I wish it could all just be in one environment but it's not" - Jesse A., Labor Manager

### 💡 The Solution: Streamlined Workflow with Real-Time Integration

Rather than asking Allied to change their proven processes, I built a system that eliminated the manual inefficiencies while keeping their existing workflow intact.

**What I Built:**

✅ **Real-time Flex API integration** - No more 24-hour delays  
✅ **Automatic contact consolidation** - Programmatically moved all Lasso contacts to Flex  
✅ **Correct time importing** - Load-in/load-out times instead of trucking dates  
✅ **Stateless application** - No duplicate data management, just smart API calls  
✅ **Intuitive crew calendar** - Visual availability tracking Jesse actually wanted to use

### 🎯 The Results: Streamlined Daily Operations

**Impact:**
- ⚡ **Eliminated repetitive data entry** - automatic sync between systems
- 🔄 **All labor information centralized in Flex** - PMs can now access crew details directly instead of contacting Jesse
- 🎯 **Familiar interface** - built to work naturally with existing AV workflows
- 💼 **Reduced daily friction** - Jesse can focus on crew coordination instead of data management

**The Process Transformation:**

**Old way:** Email → Monday form → Lasso (with wrong times) → Manual corrections → PMs contact Jesse for labor info  
**New way:** Allied Crew app → Real-time Flex updates → All stakeholders see current data

**Biggest win:** Project managers can now see labor assignments directly in Flex, eliminating the constant back-and-forth with Jesse for crew information.
